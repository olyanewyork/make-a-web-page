      How the Web Works
           </div>
      <div>
<p>
  The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. 
        </p>
  <p>The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.

HTML
     </div>
  <div>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.

Tags and Elements
      </div>
      <div>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.

  Why Computers are Stupid
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>
   </div>
<div class="concept-title">
Inline vs Block Elements
  </div>
 <div>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.

  Three languages of the web development: HTML,CSS and Java
  </div>
  <div>
<p> 
  <br>
  * HTML and CSS are both languages that will be used in this course.
    </br>
      <br>
* HTML controls the structure of the page.
      </br>
<br>
  * CSS stands for <em> Cascading Style Sheets</em>. It controls the style of the page. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"> CSS Reference Guide</a>. "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/"> How CSS Selectors Work </a>
  </br>
<br> 
* When programmers talk about the "DOM" (<em> Document Object Model</em>) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

      Developer Tools (in the Browser)
      </div>
<div>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
        Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
        content inside of them.

      The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
<div>
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
        draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
        multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        <br>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
        nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
        boxes, and so on...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-title">
      The relationship between indented HTML and boxes
</div>
      <div>
      <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
        of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

      Text Editors (for programming
      </div>
<div>
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
        Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
        life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
        generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?
  </div>
<div>
  <p>Method 1: write CSS in the <b>head</b> of your HTML. This method is good for very small projects (like what you'd do in scratchpad.io). To do this: 1. At the top of your HTML document, add a <b>head</b> element. 2. Inside the <b>head</b> element, add a <b>style</b> element. 3. Write your CSS in the <b>style</b> element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.
  </p>
  <p>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file. 
    This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this: 1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html). 2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. 3. Add a <b>head</b> element to the top of your HTML. 4. Add a link tag inside the head element. Since link is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing /link. 5. Add the following attributes to your link: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"
  </p>
   <p>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML. This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code.
